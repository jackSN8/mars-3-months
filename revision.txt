Things to be done before paper is over the line:
-6ish reentry graphs,
--low isp, high isp cases for heat flux during entry, and acceleration during the worst earth and worst mars entries

?current idea reentry sim FIGs

Fig B: Reentry Fluxs for 4 EM cases (33, 35, 370 & 380)

Fig f: Post Aerocapture orbit ME 35






-more discussion on radiation, and contrast to existing NASA plans
-improve the introduction, and how it contrasts with other fast transit work
-discuss limitations of aero models, try a bit harder to get aero model to accurately simulate earth reentry
-Say that this will not work if Starship falls quite short of its expectations
-add more references from peer reviewed journals :(
