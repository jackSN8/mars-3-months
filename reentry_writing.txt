Both trajectories involve significant aerocapture maneuvers where the Starship enters the upper atmosphere of Earth or Mars and uses atmospheric drag to deaccelerate from a hyperbolic trajectory that (at periapsis) moves faster than the respective planet's escape velocity to an elliptical captured orbit. At hyperbolic trajectories around planets have a lower curvature than captured orbits, the amount of time spent in the atmosphere is not long without other involved forces. In our proposed Earth return trajectory, the spacecraft spends 103 seconds under 120km altitude if the effects of atmospheric drag and lift are ignored. As 1.5km/s of de-acceleration is needed, this would require an average of 1G of de-acceleration which is significant considering the large altitude variations during this trajectory.
